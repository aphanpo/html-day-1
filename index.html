            <section><strong>Exploring</strong> different tags (:
            Here is an <em>emphasized</em> word. I am not sure what else to say!
            </section>

            <h2>About Me:</h2>
            <p>
                Many have tried to pronounce my lastname correctly and failed. It is a combination of both my parent's lastname.
                I am full Lao even though most people think I am Filipino. Whenever someone automatically starts talking to me in
                any type of Filipino language, I don't intend to be rude but I have to immediately stop them midsentence.
                I am born and raised in Hawaii. I moved to Las Vegas about 3 years ago because I needed a change.
                I wanted to start living the "adulthood" stages of my life. I wanted to experience true freedom and 
                learn the "hard" way to budgeting and taking care of important bills like rent.
            </p>

            <div class="topic">Lessons I've learned so far:</div>
            <ol>
                <li>Do Something!</li>
                -- Find something to do to make money. Find a job because you can't live off of savings forever.
                <li>Get Comfortable with Getting Uncomfortable</li>
                -- Being in a new environment calls for <strong>EXPLORING!</strong> Go out and make new connections.
                Las Vegas is a 24hr city so there is always something to do. There are casinos and bars all over Vegas. <br>
