        Here is an <em>emphasized</em> word. I am not sure what else to say!

        <h2>About Amy!</h2>
        <p>
            I am born and raised in Hawaii. I moved to Las Vegas about 3 years ago because I needed a change.
            I wanted to start living the "adulthood" stages of my life. I wanted to experience true freedom and 
            learn the "hard" way to budgeting and taking care of important bills like rent.
        </p>

        <p>Lessons I've learned so far:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Do Something!</li>
            -- Find something to do to make money. Find a job because you can't live off of savings forever.
            <li>Get Comfortable with Getting Uncomfortable</li>
            -- Being in a new environment calls for <strong>EXPLORING!</strong> Go out and make new connections.
            Las Vegas is a 24hr city so there is always something to do. There are casinos and bars all over Vegas.

            <br>
            <li>Adjust Your Mindset</li>
            -- Having a Positive outlook on life is important. There will be many struggles while trying to adjust but 
            staying positive will help you get through the day.
        </ol>

        <p>I am sure there are many life lessons I still need to learn while living in Las Vegas.</p>
